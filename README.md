# tooling-sheet-electron
Electron app for Windows which allows a machinist to enter in setup information and adjustments made to the main program when parts are being made on a CNC. The user enters in all relevant information, then renders the form to a pdf which is kept for internal use. 

This program was developed as volunteer work as I knew several employees at Precipart who needed a better way of tracking changes.
